# Noise Measurement of BB84 E91 Protocol Using Single Qubit in Qiskit


### Here we measured the deviation in error in _Quantum Key Distribution Protocols_ ([BB84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BB84), [E91](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E91)) when subjected to different noise models, running on a real Super Conducting Quantum Computer '[IBM-q-experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/)'/'[Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/)'.

## Abstract

_Quantum Cryptography is the quantum analog to Classical Cryptography where the key distribution is an integral part of the algorithm. Unlike Classical Computers, Quantum Computers and channels are prone to the disturbances in the environment and often these noises corrupt the information in Quantum Key Distribution procedure. As noise resistant/immune quantum computer is far from real, the only way is to correct the error induced by the noise. This has its own overhead of qubits and performance. Here we have used a real quantum computer (IBM-q-experience) to execute two QKD protocols, BB84 and E91 and subjected them to two different noise models. We measured the systems post execution and calculated the deviation in errors._
